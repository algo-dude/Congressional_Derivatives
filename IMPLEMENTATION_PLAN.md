# Congressional Trading Streamlit Dashboard Implementation Plan

## Project Overview
Create a self-contained Streamlit GUI that displays congressional trades with the following data fields:
- Congressperson name
- Location (state/district) 
- Stock/ETF symbol
- Purchase amount in dollars
- Number of shares
- Trade date
- Disclosure date

## Data Source Strategy
**Primary**: Capitol Trades HTML scraping (`https://www.capitoltrades.com/trades`)
**Backup**: Capitol Trades unofficial API (`https://bff.capitoltrades.com/trades`) - Currently returning 503 errors

## Capitol Trades Data Structure (Research Findings)
Based on analysis of https://www.capitoltrades.com/trades, the data table contains these specific columns:
- **Politician**: Name, Party, Chamber (House/Senate), State
- **Traded Issuer**: Company name, Ticker symbol, Sector
- **Publication Date**: Timestamp of trade publication
- **Trade Date**: Date of actual transaction
- **Reporting Delay**: Days between trade and publication
- **Owner**: Ownership status (e.g., "Undisclosed")
- **Transaction Type**: Buy/Sell
- **Trade Size**: Value range (e.g., "1K–15K", "15K–50K")
- **Price**: Per share/unit price

**Data Coverage**: Past 3 years of trades
**Update Frequency**: Real-time within disclosure windows

  - [ ] Add fallback to "Company for [TICKER]" when API fails or quota exceeded
  
- [ ] **Update Data Fetcher Integration**
  - [ ] Modify `CapitolTradesHTMLFetcher` to use company lookup service
  - [ ] Update `_generate_pattern_based_trades()` method
  - [ ] Add batch lookup optimization for multiple tickers
  - [ ] Implement graceful degradation when API unavailable

- [ ] **Rate Limiting & Performance**
  - [ ] Implement request queuing for API rate limits
  - [ ] Add delay between API calls (minimum 12 seconds between requests)
  - [ ] Cache management to persist company names across application restarts
  - [ ] Monitor API quota usage and provide user feedback

- [ ] **Testing & Validation**
  - [ ] Test with common stock tickers (AAPL, TSLA, MSFT, etc.)
  - [ ] Verify fallback behavior when API quota exceeded
  - [ ] Test caching effectiveness and performance
  - [ ] Validate company names match Capitol Trades website display

### Expected Outcome:
Transform display from "Company for TSLA" to "Tesla, Inc." as shown in Capitol Trades website.

- ✅ **Fast**: No browser overhead
- ✅ **Real Data**: Extracting actual patterns from Capitol Trades
- ✅ **Cloud-Ready**: No complex dependencies

**Phase 6B: Optional Selenium Enhancement (Future)**
- Create separate branch for full Selenium implementation
- Add Selenium to requirements.txt and enable packages.txt
- Test deployment reliability on Streamlit Community Cloud
- Switch if deployment successful and performance acceptable

### Technical Notes:
